# AngularTabulator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

Then I made a few edits to add the [tabulator grid](https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator) - and wrap it in its own component.

(Angular version is now 19)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Tabulator Grid

This is the most amamzing open source javascript grid that I know about.

Check it out here: - [https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator](https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator)

P.S. There were some code changes needed when updating to tabulator 5.0

(if you used tabulator 4.x before - then check out [http://tabulator.info/docs/5.0/upgrade](http://tabulator.info/docs/5.0/upgrade))
